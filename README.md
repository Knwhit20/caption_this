#Caption This

Deployed on Heroku at: https://caption-this-project.herokuapp.com/

##Purpose: 
Caption This was created to provide  entertainment to the user, reduce  work productivity, improve the user's wit and sarcasm.

##How to use:  
The user is provided with carefully selected images populated with user captions.  The user can enjoy reading other user's witty captions or add their own.  To add a caption, simply click on an image, add a comment to the field and click post.  Each time the screen is refreshed the image will be randomly populated with a different caption.
